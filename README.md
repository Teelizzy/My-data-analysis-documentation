# My-data-analysis-documentation
This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis with INCUBATOR HUB  and with TECHMINDS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

### Project Title: Data Analysis

### Project Preview
The aim of this data analysis is to clean data, transform data, extract data and to do statistical analysis inorder discover useful information, draw conclusion and to support descition making.

### Data Sources
The primary sources data is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other reprository site.

### Tools Used
- Microsofy excel 
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. Data Extraction
  3. Data Processing
  4. Statistical Analysis
  5. Data Virtualization
 
- SQL-Structured Query Language for Querrying Data
- Power BI
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, I perform the foloowing action;

      1. Data loading and Inspection
      2. Handling missing variables
      3. Remove blanks
      4. Remove duplicates
      5. Replace missing values
      6. Maintain data consistency
