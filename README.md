This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis with INCUBATOR HUB  and with TECHMINDS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

### Project Title: Data Analysis

### Project Preview

### Tools Used
- Microsofy excel 
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. Data Processing
  3. Statistical Analysis
  4. Data Virtualization
 
- SQL-Structured Query Language for Querrying Data
- Power BI
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, I perform the foloowing action;

      1. Data loading and Inspection
